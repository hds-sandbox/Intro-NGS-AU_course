    "one of the many available clustering techniques. When identifying a\n",
    "cluster, we can assign that to a likely cell type by visualizing known\n",

    "### Print markers’ scores\n",

    "The first step to identify various cell types is to print markers on the\n",

Remember that the [scanpy webpage](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) has a lot of tutorials and very good documentation for all the functions implemented. The universe of available tools for single cell RNA data is growing constantly and is difficult to navigate - I suggest you to try tools that seem interesting, are usable without too many dificulties, and then stick only to those that are really relevant. Fortunately the community revolving around scRNA-seq data analysis is huge and rather helpful and open-source. It is mostly a matter of googling yourself to relevant forums and github repositories to find useful answers to doubts, available tools, and guides.\n",
