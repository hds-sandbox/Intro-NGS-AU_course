    "We will start by analyzing a dataset coming from various sections of human testicular tissue.\n",
    "The testis is a complex organ composed of multiple cell types: germ cells at different stages of maturation and several somatic cell types supporting testicular structure and spermatogenesis (development of cells into spermatozoa); Sertoli cells, peritubular cells, Leydig cells, and other interstitial cells, as outlined in the figure below. Characterizing the various cell types is important to understand which genes and processes are relevant at different levels of maturations of cells into spermatozoa.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/celltypes.png\" width=\"700\" alt=\"Tubule scheme\" class=\"center\">\n",
    "<figcaption> Figure: section of a tubule of the human testis. The human testis are surrounded by long tubules in which cells <br>start to develop, beginning from the walls of the tubules towards the center. At the center of the tubule, <br>spermatozoa will access to the epididymis to reach full maturation. </figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "After characterizing the spermatogenic process, we will perform comparative analysis of our dataset to testicular samples from men affected by azoospermia (reduced or absent froduction of spermatozoa). Infertility is a growing problem, especially in the Western world, where approximately 10–15% of couples are infertile. In about half of the infertile couples, the cause involves a male-factor ([Agarwal et al. 2015](https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-015-0032-1); [Barratt et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28981651/)). One of the most severe forms of male infertility is azoospermia (from greek *azo*, *without life*) where no spermatozoa can be detected in the ejaculate, which renders biological fatherhood difficult. Azoospermia is found in approximately 10–15% of infertile men ([Jarow et al. 1989](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2499695/); [Olesen et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27793385/)) and the aetiology is thought to be primarily genetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common to the various azoospermic conditions is the lack or distuption of gene expression patterns. It makes therefore sense to detect genes expressed more in the healthy dataset against the azoospermic one. We can also investigate gene enrichment databases to get a clearer picture of what the genes of interest are relevant to.\n",

    "<figcaption> Figure: Examples of testicular histology and the composition of testicular cell types that can be observed among men with various types of azoospermia. Degenerated ghost tubules (#) are tubules where an abnormally large central channel is present, but no cells are developing from the walls of the tubule. Other tubules show Sertoli-cell-only (SCO) pattern (*) and large clusters of Leydig cells, meaning they only have nurse cells, but no developing germ cells. Tubules with germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) do not contain any normal germ cells (&). GCNIS cells are the precursor cells of testicular germ cell cancer and are found more frequently among men with azoospermia than among men with good semen quality.

    "\n",
    "Biologically similar cells are not necessarily **directly comparable** in a dataset because of different technical biases - amongst many the different percentage of captured transcripts (capture efficiency), the presence of technical replicates, the presence of noisy transcripts. The capture efficiency can be influenced by many factors, i.e. the different transcript tags leading to different capture efficiency, the type of protocol used in the laboratory, the amount of PCR performed on different transcripts. Biological biases might as well alter the transcript proportion in a cell, for example in case of different points in the cell cycles altering the expression of specific genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these differences, a **normalization** approach is needed. Normalization is one of the main topics of scRNAseq data preprocessing, and many advanced techniques take into account the statistical distribution of counts and the presence of technical/biological features of interest ([Lytal et al, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00041/full)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most standard approach is the **TMP (Transcript Per Million) normalization**. Here, the transcripts is each cell are rescaled by a factor such that the transcripts in each cell sum to the same value. After TPM rescaling, the data is usually logarithmized, so that a transcript $x$ becomes $log(x+1)$. Logarithmization is known to help reducing the technical bias induced by the amount of transcripts in each cell. Finally, the data is standardized with mean 0 and variance 1. This is necessary since the PCA assumes implicitly that datapoints are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, TPM works fine but might introduce biases in the data, mostly due to technical differences that are not always removed by normalization. It is possible to use more advanced methods for considering technical and biological covariates as part of a statistical model for the transcripts. One of the current state-of-the-art method is *scTransform* ([Hafemeister and Satija, 2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1)).

This means that the two PC components mostly describe variations in the technical features and misses the description of biological variation. We will see after normalization that these correlations are reduced. Note that we are plotting the correlations for one specific sample, `Guo1`, but the concept holds for the remaining samples."

    "PCA and UMAP are two of the many projection methods available at the moment. Before UMAP, a very popular method was (and still is) tSNE [van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf). tSNE tries to match the statistical distribution of the high-dimensional data and its projection. The statistical distribution modeling high-dimensional data is controlled by a parameter called *perplexity*, defining how far away cells are considered to be in the neighbourhood of a cell. The largest the perplexity, the farther away cells are going to be pulled close to each other in the tSNE projection. In general, tSNE is not very good at keeping the global behaviour of the data into account, while it often pulls cells together in separate chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the perplexity can change a lot the output of tSNE, even though it has shown empirically being stable with values between 5 and 50.\n",
    "Here you can experiment different values of the perplexity and plot tSNE. You will see how - for lower perplexities - tSNE cannot keep the dataset together as in the UMAP projection, dividing it instead into many chunks covering a large 2D space. The tSNE algorithm is actually quite slow, especially with increasing perplexity, so we will subsample the dataset to be only 5000 cells. If you must wait too long to get the code executed, reduce this number even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also change the method measuring distances between points. The standard distance is `euclidean`, and you can change this parameter with `cityblock`, `cosine`, `euclidean`, `l1`, `l2`, `manhattan`, `braycurtis`, `canberra`, `chebyshev`, `correlation`, `dice`, `hamming`, `jaccard`, `kulsinski`, `mahalanobis`, `minkowski`, `rogerstanimoto`, `russellrao`, `seuclidean`, `sokalmichener`, `sokalsneath`, `sqeuclidean`, `yule`.

    "It has been a pretty long one, but I hope you learnt new things and you will benefit from them in your future scRNA-seq analysis. Remember that the [scanpy webpage](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) has a lot of tutorials and very good documentation for all the functions implemented. The universe of available tools for single cell RNA data is growing constantly and is difficult to navigate - I suggest you to try tools that seem interesting, are usable without too many dificulties, and then stick only to those that are really relevant. Fortunately the community revolving around scRNA-seq data analysis is huge and rather helpful and open-source. It is mostly a matter of googling yourself to relevant forums and github repositories to find useful answers to doubts, available tools, and guides."
