# Access through uCloud

`Ucloud` is an interactive online platform from the [University of Southern Danmark eScience center](https://escience.sdu.dk/) that allows users to execute softwares and computer code directly from their browser. If you have an account from a danish university, hospital, and other institutions, you can access the platform for free and try the course.

## Work on the tutorial

To work on the tutorial you need to go on a personal folder, which contains also the dataset you will filter after the tutorial. Each student has its own folder as in the table below:

| Name | Sample folder |
|---|---|
| Andersen, Albert Lund  | Gifu_ctr_1  |
| Bagger, Andreas	  | Gifu_ctr_2  |
| Hansen, Mads Würgler	  | Gifu_ctr_ 3 |
| Milo, Lasse	  | Gifu_ctr_4  |
| Reimick, Sebastian Haunstrup  | Gifu_R7A_1  |
| Hemmingsen, Jonas Klejs  | Gifu_R7A_2  |
| Skovmøller, Emma Hvitfeldt  | Gifu_R7A_3  |
| Sørensen, Emma Frasez  | Gifu_R7A_4  |
|Agersnap, Simon Nørregaard | HAR1_ctr_1 |
| Schmidt, Alina | HAR1_ctr_2 |
|Henriksen, Frederik Oskar | HAR1_ctr_3  |
|Lundby, Josephine Marie | HAR1_ctr_4 |
|Nørholm, Anne | HAR1_R7A_1 |
|Odgaard, Louise Nyrup | HAR1_R7A_2 |
|Sørensen, Sara Sejer | HAR1_R7A_3 |
|Lønskov, Jonas | HAR1_R7A_4 |
|Niklassen, Jacob Hansen | Gifu_ctr_1_bis |
|Øllgaard, Ann Mai Brøndum Holm | Gifu_ctr_2_bis |
|Overgaard, Morten Øgelund | Gifu_R7A_1_bis |
|Sørensen, Elisabeth Asta | Gifu_R7A_2_bis |
|Rey, Isabel | HAR1_ctr_1_bis |

* When you open jupyterlab, you need to use the browser on your left to go to the folder `426401/Students_analysis/Folder_name`, where you find your personal folder (from the table) instead of `Folder_name`.

* Here, you have the notebook `tutorial.ipynb`. Open that to start working on the tutorial
* When you open the notebook, on the top-right corner you should have `R scrna` (red circle). If not, click there and choose `R scrna` from the menu that appears.

* Now you can start working on the tutorial. There is a lot of text to read and of course code to run.

When you are finished with the tutorial, you are ready to go on to use the tutorial code for the [filtering session](./filtering.md).
